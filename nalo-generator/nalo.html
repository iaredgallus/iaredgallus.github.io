                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>
                    This tool generates random sentences in Nalo that are both grammatically correct and true to nature.
                    Sentences are built <a href="#program-details">using only Nalo from beginning to end</a> rather 
                    than translating from English to Nalo, so English translations are currently unavailable. 
                    Short of learning basic Nalo, you'll have to take on faith that the generator is 
                    working as prescribed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though not immediately useful to visitors, this tool proves useful <i>to me</i> 
                    for enhancing my own Nalo comprehension. It generates sentences that I wouldn't have crafted
                    on my own, and since I have few real-life interlocutors, I appreciate the fresh content.
                    Beyond this, the fleshing out of Nalo dovetails nicely with future fiction-writing aspirations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most practically, this tool exemplifies a functional, complex JavaScript program that 
                    has been integrated seemlessly with a webpage. 
                    Even if you don't <i>nalo</i> right now, you'll notice (hopefully!) that each sentence is novel 
                    and that the user experience is clean.

                <h2>About Nalo</h2>
                <p>Nalo is a constructed language that I started building in 2023. <i>Nalo</i> translates to "inclination of the tongue." 
                Here are some fast facts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nalo uses the most common sounds across all human languages:<br /> 
                        <i>vowels</i> (aeiou), <i>consonants</i> (mnptkfsx<sup class="small">1</sup>lr<sup class="small">2</sup>wy).</li>
                    <li>Some core words are formed via onomatopeoia. For example, <i>la</i> (water) 
                    mimics dripping water, while <i>sa</i> (fire) imitates the hiss of a campfire.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Other core words are formed by mapping pairs of natural phenomena onto arbitrary pairs of syllables. For example, <i>toward</i> and <i>from</i> are opposite ideas, so they are represented by syllables 
                    articulated at opposite ends of the mouth (<i>ka</i> and <i>pa</i> respectively).</li>
                    <li>Complex words are formed by compounding or metaphorizing core words. For example, 
                        <i>nalo</i> (language) is a compound of <i>na</i> (desire) and <i>lo</i> (tongue).
                    </li>
                    <li>Grammar is largely regular. Core grammatical words include <i>o</i> to mark subject, 
                        <i>a</i> to mark location, and <i>ka</i>/<i>pa</i> to mark movement.</li>
                </ul>
                <sup>1 pronounced "ch" or "sh", interchangeably<br />
                2 trilled or tapped, interchangeably</sup>

                <h2>Program Details</h2>
                <p>As mentioned above, this tool generates random sentences in Nalo that are 
                    both grammatically correct and semantically logical. In the sentences generated,
                    something without eyes will never "see," and subjects without agency will never use the active voice.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    To accomplish this, verbs are grouped semantically via JavaScript Objects, 
                    and these Objects determine which actors and recipients are appropriate for each verb.
