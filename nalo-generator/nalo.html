                <h2>Purpose</h2>
                <p>
                    This tool generates random sentences in <a href="#about-nalo">Nalo</a> that are grammatically correct and semantically logical 
                    (i.e. "not nonsense"). Sentences are built using Nalo from the ground up, so English translations are 
                    currently unavailable. Short of learning Nalo, you'll have to take on faith that the generator is 
                    working as prescribed.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Though not immediately useful to visitors, this tool is useful
                    for enhancing my own Nalo comprehension: it generates sentences that I wouldn't have crafted
                    on my own, and since I have few real-life interlocutors, all fresh content is helpful.
                    Moreover, the fleshing out of a constructed language dovetails nicely with future fiction-writing aspirations. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most practically, this tool exemplifies a functional JavaScript program that 
                    has been integrated with a webpage. Even if you don't understand the sentences, you'll notice (hopefully!) that each sentence is novel 
                    and that the user experience is clean.

                <h2 id="about-nalo">About Nalo</h2>
                <p>Nalo is a constructed language that I started building in 2023. <i>Nalo</i> simply means "words."
                Here are some fast facts:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Nalo uses the most common sounds across all human languages:<br /> 
                        <i>vowels</i> (<span class="extra-space">aeiou</span>), <i>consonants</i> (<span class="extra-space">mnptkfsx<sup class="small">1</sup>lr<sup class="small">2</sup>wy</span>).</li>
                    <li>Many core words are formed via onomatopeoia. For example, <i>la</i> (water) 
                    mimics dripping water, while <i>sa</i> (fire) imitates the hiss of a campfire.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                    Other core words are formed by mapping pairs of natural phenomena onto arbitrary pairs of syllables. For example, <i>toward</i> and <i>from</i> are opposite ideas, so they are represented by syllables 
                    articulated at opposite ends of the mouth (<i>ka</i> and <i>pa</i> respectively).</li>
                    <li>Complex words are formed by compounding or metaphorizing core words. For example, 
                        <i>nalo</i> (words) is a compound of <i>na</i> (desire) and <i>lo</i> (tongue).
                    </li>
                    <li>Grammar is largely regular. Core grammatical words include <i>o</i> to mark subject, 
                        <i>a</i> to mark location, and <i>ka</i>/<i>pa</i> to mark movement.<br />
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <sup>1 pronounced "ch" or "sh", interchangeably<br />
                2 trilled or tapped, interchangeably</sup>

                <h2>Program Details</h2>
                <p>As mentioned above, this tool generates semantically logical sentences. 
                    Ergo, something without eyes will never "see," 
                    and subjects without agency will not use the active voice.
                </p>
                <p>
                    To accomplish this, all Nalo words are grouped by meaning into arrays, 
                    and these arrays live inside JavaScript Objects.
                    Each Object oversees a specific class of verbs (the root)
                    and determines which actors (sources) and recipients (goals) 
                    are logically appropriate for its verbs.
                </p>
                <p class="code-p">
                    <code>
                    let ActionLand = {<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;root: [verbsLand],<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;sources: [wordPronounAll, wordAnimalLand],<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;goals: [wordObjectNatureLand, wordObjectNatureWater,<br />
                        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;wordTool, wordAnimalLand, wordAnimalSky, wordAnimalWater]<br />
                    }</code>
                </p>
                <p>
                    When run, the program selects an Object at random.
                    It asks the Object for a verb, an actor, and a recipient.
                    Depending on the class of verb, the program may also ask for additional sentence parts 
                    (adjectives, adverbs, etc.). 
                    If allowed, the Object returns valid options for these as well.
                </p>
